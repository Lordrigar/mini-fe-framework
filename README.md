# Vanilla JS App for SpaceX API

Goal is to create SPA with Real Time data fetching without use of frameworks.

TODO:

- Create more components (to have more data to play with)
- Switch to createElement and figure out how to re-render with it
- Figure out what to do with event listeners to scale it at large (too much dependency on adding/removing event listeners)
