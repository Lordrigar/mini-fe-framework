# Mini FE Framework

Started as an idea to create an app with component rendering and state management and evolved into small side project to understand how rendering and state management work.

Right now features class components with scoped state, Global event based state, wrapper function for creating DOM elements, router.

This is probably not secure enough for production use, but it was fun playing with it :)

TODO:

- Create more components (to have more data to play with)
- Build router
