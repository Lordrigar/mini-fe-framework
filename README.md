# Vanilla JS App for SpaceX API

Goal is to create SPA with Real Time data fetching without use of frameworks.

App features:

- Local and global state (event based)
- Re-rendering of only those components that require it

TODO:

- cleanup store and methods
- add checks for methods to check the right arguments are passed
- clean index.js to import components and all even listeners
- clean Home.js and add button creation etc inside class
- create function components for elements like button etc and import them to Home
